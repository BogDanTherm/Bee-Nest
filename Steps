To code mini drones to function autonomously, follow steps and components, including:

Sensor Integration: Integrating sensors such as cameras, microphones, and other sensory devices to gather information about the environment.

Navigation System: Implementing a navigation system to guide the drone to its target and avoid obstacles. This could involve algorithms for mapping and localization, as well as path planning and control.

Power Management: Ensuring the drone has a reliable power source and can manage its power consumption effectively.

Communication System: Implementing a communication system for the drone to communicate with a ground station or other control system.

Control System: Implementing a control system that can interpret sensor data, make decisions, and control the drone's movements.

Safety Mechanisms: Implementing safety mechanisms to ensure the drone does not cause harm to people or the environment, such as emergency landing procedures and collision avoidance systems.

These are just a few of the key components that would need to be considered when coding mini drones to function autonomously. The specific implementation will depend on the requirements of the drone, the environment it will operate in, and the tasks it will need to perform.
